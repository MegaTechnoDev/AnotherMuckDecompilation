## Acknowledgements


This repository is a modified version of [Sodiboo](https://github.com/sodiboo)'s Muck decompilation repository which also includes several QoL modification. This Repo fixes several major issues regarding its functionality and also adds several other modified QoL features.


### Notes
This isn't a decomp of the latest version of Muck! This is a decompilation of Muck's second update. Update2 (v1.2)
The latest version is to be released soon! I will be creating another repository possibly abandoning this one in the process.
